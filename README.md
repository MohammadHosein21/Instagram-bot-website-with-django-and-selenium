# Instagram-bot-website-with-django-and-selenium
In this project, a web-based Instagram bot has been implemented with the help of the Django framework and the bot module. In this website, after registration, the user can enter his account details, enter the desired hashtag related to the subject of his account, and the robot will perform the necessary tasks in a scheduled manner to increase the number of followers of the user account.
